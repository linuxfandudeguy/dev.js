<p>It all began with my ambitious project to create a desktop application using Electron. My setup started on a ChromeOS machine, which is not traditionally known for being ideal for such tasks. But I dove in anyway, determined to make it work.</p>
<p>Initially, I set up my project directory and began the process of packaging my files. That’s when the real trouble started. I ran the command to package everything, only to find myself repeatedly modifying the <code>package.json</code> file in what felt like an endless cycle. The constant changes were maddening, and I installed an array of packages   <code>build-essential libgtk-3-dev libnss3 libxkbcommon-x11-dev</code>
most of which turned out to be unnecessary.</p>
<p>After struggling with a particular packager for over an hour, I discovered that it didn’t even work. Frustrated, I switched to a different packager, hoping for a better outcome. Finally, after significant effort and persistence, the successful packager managed to complete the process.</p>
<p>When it was all done, I delivered the packaged files to Google Drive for distribution. The moment of triumph was short-lived, however, as I was still stuck with the aftermath of my struggles.</p>
<p>To clean up, I executed the dreaded <code>rm -rf</code> command to delete the project directory. It felt like a cleansing act after the chaos I had endured. Despite the cleanup, I was relieved to see my computer running faster and more efficiently.</p>
<p>Looking back, I can’t help but agree with those who criticize Electron. The process was tortuous, and the excessive RAM usage was beyond frustrating. I spent countless hours dealing with issues, and the end result, while successful, came at a significant cost in terms of time and sanity.</p>
<p>In the end, I made a desktop application, but the experience has left me with a newfound respect for those who navigate Electron’s complexities. </p>
