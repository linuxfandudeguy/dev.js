<p>Starting the project was straightforward. I set up the project directory and began with high hopes. However, things quickly became complicated when I ran the command to package everything. The process required me to modify the <code>package.json</code> file an unnecessary number of times, and I found myself installing a plethora of random packages.</p>
<p>The first packager I tried didn't work, wasting an hour of my time. Frustrated, I switched to a different packager. Thankfully, this one worked, but by then, I was already feeling the strain.</p>
<p>After the successful packaging, I deleted the project directory using the <code>rm -rf</code> command. To add to my frustration, I was working on a computer not traditionally known for such tasksâ€”ChromeOS.</p>
<p>The process of delivering the files to a CDN was also a challenge. There weren't many free CDN solutions available, so I ended up using Google Drive. The packaged file weighed about 245M, adding to the complexity of the process.</p>
<p>In the end, I managed to create a desktop application, which is now available for download. But the entire experience made me empathize deeply with those who dislike Electron. The excessive RAM usage, constant modifications, and the sheer amount of time spent were overwhelming. I went to bed tired as hell with a hurting head.</p>
<p>Despite the frustrations, I am glad I made the application. However, I now fully understand why some developers have a strong aversion to Electron.</p>
